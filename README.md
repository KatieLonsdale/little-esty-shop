# Little Esty Shop

## Background and Description

"Little Esty Shop" is a group project that required us to build a fictitious e-commerce platform where merchants and admins can manage inventory and fulfill customer invoices.

## Learning Goals
    In addition to the learning goals set before us by the program(see the bulleted list below), we as a group had some of our own learning goals.
    We wanted to employ advanced routing techniques, learn how to make custom rake commands that we used to import our CVS files, play with CSS styling, improve our sad path testing and edge cases.

- Practice designing a normalized database schema and defining model relationships
- Utilize advanced routing techniques including namespacing to organize and group like functionality together.
- Utilize advanced active record techniques to perform complex database queries
- Practice consuming a public API while utilizing POROs as a way to apply OOP principles to organize code

## Planning and Organization

We utilizied Miro, Slack and GitHub Project Board to stay organized with our task, goals and obstacles.

We had daily morning stand-ups and worked regularly together via zoom and slack huddle.

We had a great balance between driver/navigator and async work.
All pull requests were filled out via a template which standardized our information/communnication. Pull request notifications were made via slack.

## Retro

We had a lot of obstacles for this project. Many of which were due to each of ourselves wanting to learn as much as possible and employee as many new tools as we could. This slowed us down and we never really picked the pace back up but it was not for lack of effort. The entore team excelled at communication and being supportive of one another.

There are many things that we would like to refactor given the time.
- routes
- factorybot
- helper methods and partials
- more sad path testing and edge cases
- being able to deploy using the API
